# PokeCopy
Personal Unity project used for learning some basics of game development using as basis the Pokemon series.

Heavily inspired by a series of you tube videos on https://www.youtube.com/c/GameDevExperiments 
 
Some changes were made in relation to the code presented. Many default Unity features, like Buttons and the UI, were used on this project so the code was change accordingly.
